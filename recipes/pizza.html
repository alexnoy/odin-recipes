        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Next time you're craving pizza, may I suggest skipping delivery and baking pizza at home instead? I promise, you won't regret it! This recipe is a weekly staple and a favorite of mine.

            So what makes it so great? Let's start with the pizza crust, which is soooo crispy, chewy, and flavorful. The pizza sauce has incredible flavor and you can easily make it up to 3 days in advance! And finally, let's talk toppings. I topped this homemade pepperoni pizza with the perfect amount of cheese and pepperoni! Enough to add flavor without making it too messy to eat.
