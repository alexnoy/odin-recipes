        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I can't really explain why I decided to create this chili dog mac and cheese hybrid. I always get a few requests for comforting casseroles this time of year, but if the goal was to end up with a recipe that tasted like both things, I failed miserably. On the other hand, if a tasty, comforting casserole was the mission, then let's celebrateâ€¦and invite a few friends, since this thing is huge.</p>
